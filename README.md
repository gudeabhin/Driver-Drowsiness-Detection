Drowsiness Alert System

37% of the world accidents happen as the driver falls a sleep while driving,so in order to reduce the number we are planning a driver dorwsiness system in which the prototype detects if the driver is sleeping or is about to fall a sleep and then it takes the priority measures, we are trying to implement this prototype using  open cv in python .
 When the driver closes the eye for 2 seconds then an alert will occur in the car .

IMP FOR THE CODE:

We are having a pretrained data dat file which is to be there in the code in order to simulate. Since the dat file size exceeds 100 MB we are providing a google drive link for that file.
